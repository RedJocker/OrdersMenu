<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Waiters can input the amount ordered for every
    item on menu, but they still can't register the
    order.
</p>
<p>
    Let's add a button to register the order.
    When an order is made send a visual feedback
    with the order summary.
    Also the amount stock should be decreased,
    the order amount for each item should be reset to zero
    and the limit on new orders should follow the new stock state.
</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Add a <code>Button</code>
        with background color black
        and content color white.
        Inside the <code>Button</code>
        add a <code>Text</code>
        with text <code>"Make Order"</code>
        and font size <code>24sp</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Add an <code>onClick</code> listener on the button
        that trigger an event to register the order
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the button is clicked
                with all order quantities equal to zero
                then do nothing
            </li>
            <li>
                If the button is clicked
                and one item only has quantity greater than zero
                then Toast a message with the following format
                <code>
                    "Ordered:\n==> ${recipeName}: $orderAmount"
                </code>
                and update the stock amount of that recipe
            </li>
            <li>
                If the button is clicked
                and many items have quantity greater than zero
                then Toast a message that besides the same
                header as the case above
                also has one line for each of those items
                using the same recipe line format as the case above
                and update the stock of each ordered item
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        After an order is made
        <ul>
            <li>Update the stock amount</li>
            <li>
                Visual cues and limit to order amount should follow
                the new state of stock amount
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare to receive new orders by resetting
                ordered amount to 0
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
