<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Besides the title we would like to list menu items.
</p>
<p>
    Let's start by adding just one menu item below the title.

</p>

<p>
    But we also would like to visually differentiate
    the title from menu items.
    Let's use styling and position
    to signal the difference.
</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the existing Title component be displayed at the center with text size 48dp;</li>
    <li>
        Add a new component MenuItem that only holds a Text with text "Fettuccine";
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the component MenuItem to be displayed at the start with text size 24dp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Display MenuItem bellow Title;
    </li>
</ol>
