<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    We don't want to just list menu items on our app.
    We should also give waiters a way to adjust
    the quantity of a certain menu item that will be ordered.
    Also we should limit the amount ordered
    considering the amount in stock otherwise
    the kitchen won't be able to complete the order.
</p>
<p>
    Let's improve the MenuItem component so that waiters can click
    to increase/decrease amount ordered
    and see the what is the current amount.
    Change text to red if the amount ordered is on max limit.
</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add a Text with text "+" on same line as the existing Text with text "Fettuccine"</li>
    <li>Add a onClick to "+" so that the amountOrdered increases after it is clicked</li>
    <li>
        Add a Text on same line as the existing Text with text "Fettuccine"
        set text to the current amountOrdered
    </li>
    <li>
        The initial amount ordered is 0
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a Text with text "-" on same line as existing Text with text "Fettuccine"
    </li>
    <li>Add a onClick to "-" so that the amountOrdered increases after it is clicked</li>
    <li>If the amountOrdered has not yet achieved the amountStock make "Fettuccine" text color black</li>
    <li>
        If the amountOrdered is equal to the amountStock make "Fettuccine" text color red
    </li>
    <li>
        amountOrdered cannot be negative nor bigger than amountStock
    </li>
    <li>
        consider the amountStock of "Fettuccine" to be 5
    </li>
</ol>
