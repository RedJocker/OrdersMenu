<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    We don't want to just list menu items on our app.
    Give waiters a way to adjust
    the amount ordered of a certain menu item.
    Also limit the amount ordered
    considering the amount in stock otherwise
    the kitchen won't be able to complete the order.
</p>
<p>
    Let's improve the MenuItem composable so that waiters can click
    to increase/decrease amount ordered
    and see the what is the current amount.
    Change text to red if the amount ordered is on max limit.
</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Consider <code>amountOrdered</code> to be
        the quantity to be ordered of a certain menu item.
        The initial <code>amountOrdered</code> value is <code>0</code>;
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider <code>amountStock</code> to be
        the quantity in stock of a certain menu item.
        The initial <code>amountStock</code> for "Fettuccine" is <code>5</code>;
    </li>
    <li>Add a Text with text "+" on same line as the existing Text with text "Fettuccine";</li>
    <li>Add a onClick to "+" so that the <code>amountOrdered</code> increases after it is clicked;</li>
    <li>
        Add a Text on same line as the existing Text with text "Fettuccine"
        set text to the current <code>amountOrdered</code>;
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a Text with text "-" on same line as existing Text with text "Fettuccine";
    </li>
    <li>Add a onClick to "-" so that the <code>amountOrdered</code> decreases after it is clicked;</li>
    <li>
        If the <code>amountOrdered</code> has not yet achieved the <code>amountStock</code>
        make "Fettuccine" text color black
    </li>
    <li>
        If the <code>amountOrdered</code> is equal to the <code>amountStock</code>
        make "Fettuccine" text color red
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>amountOrdered</code> of a certain menu item
        cannot be negative nor bigger than <code>amountStock</code>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    obs: for simplification reasons we are not considering
    the subject of dark-mode on our requirements.
