<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Our composable MenuItem is working, but the menu has more than
    just Fettuccine. Let's display a list of MenuItem with all
    the recipes on menu.
</p>
<p>
    The logic for each MenuItem should take into consideration
    the stock for that specific item
    and restrict the order's amount like was done on last stage.
</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Each composable MenuItem has
        a recipe name,
        a plus,
        an order amount
        and a minus
        like the one that already exists for Fettuccine.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the following data that represent
        the relation between recipe name and stock amount
        <br><br>

        <pre><code>
    val recipesNameToStockAmount = mapOf(
            "Fettuccine" to 5,
            "Risotto" to 6,
            "Gnocchi" to 4,
            "Spaghetti" to 3,
            "Lasagna" to 5,
            "Steak Parmigiana" to 2
    )</code></pre><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create one MenuItem for each recipe
    </li>
    <li>
        Each recipe has it's own orderAmount and stockAmount
        and the logic for each MenuItem should take only
        it's own recipe into consideration
    </li>
    <li>
        Display all recipes as a list of MenuItem
    </li>
</ol>
