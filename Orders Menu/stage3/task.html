<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Besides the title we would like to list menu items.
</p>
<p>
    To be able to visually differentiate
    the title from the rest of the text content,
    let's use styling and position to signal this difference.
</p>

    <li>Make the existing Title component be displayed at the center with text size 48dp </li>
